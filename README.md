Updated plan:

- Make a new HTML page for every question
- But run a python if statement within each @app.route so that it asks IF there are any questions remaining before rendering a template
- If there are no more questions remaining, then just show the results page
- Calculates results after every question asked
- remember to use dynamic pages to make every question page so that I don't have to copy and paste everything
- Figure out how to get checkbox data
